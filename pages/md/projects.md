I am a creativity addict so I jiggle around with code from time to time. These are some projects of mine:

## Logger-Diary
<div class="derivi-twivi">

## Project FNew

<div class="derivi-twivi">
'A minecraft datapack revolving around a shady guy named Henri', pretty cringe maybe idk
</div>

## Project Embloidium

<div class="derivi-twivi">
A set of chatbots that could add new reactions on themselves (wouldn't call it AI), that I worked on from my 13th till my 17th, on a combination of
<ul>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>Batch (yes, the windows cmd file thing)</li>
<li>Electron/NodeJS</li>
</ul>
With somehow a pretty good result. Mostly.
</div>

Keeping this code private for now.


## HL-IMG.js [<img src="/assets/img/github-mark.svg" height="20px" alt="GitHub">](https://github.com/strawmelonjuice/hl-img.js/) [<img src="https://www.jsdelivr.com/assets/5c45c9be8960b51a5e8ad5bc3ad6492bfbcb0dcf/img/icons/jsdelivr_icon.svg" height="20px" alt="JSdelivr">](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/gh/strawmelonjuice/hl-img.js)

<div class="derivi-twivi">
I actually created this project just to make <a href="/blog?p=posts/art/mousemouse-3.2">a post on here</a> prettier! It allows you to create highlightable images, for coding comfort in a custom element type. I work at this project mostly at night, which, well, explains.
</div>


## This site

<div class="derivi-twivi">
Yeah, this site is a little project of its own (at the time of writing, the one with the most commits lol).
However, it's not open source. Instead, I'm planning to make a separate project that works <i>kinda</i> like this site, as a CMS for small blogs with experienced bloggers.
</div>
This site itself is running on private server-side code.
