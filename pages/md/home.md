## Projects

I am a creativity addict so I jiggle around with code from time to time. These are some projects of mine:

### Logger-Diary
<div class="derivi-twivi">

- [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strawmelonjuice/logger-diary.legacy/desktop-beta/logger/icons/logo.png" height="25px" alt="LD Logo"> Logger-Diary Legacy](https://github.com/strawmelonjuice/logger-diary.legacy) – discontinued
- `My Log 231 for FreeDOS` – discontinued & way too old but I find it funny to mention

### Project FNew
<div class="derivi-twivi">
A social media site that doesn't have a name yet... or a figured out concept
</div>
Not yet open source nor publicized
### [WWW-bot](https://github.com/strawmelonjuice/wwwbot-discord)
<div class="derivi-twivi">
    A discord bot to moderate and automate my cute lil discord server <code>that barely has any members :c</code>
</div>


### [Henri The Datapack](https://github.com/strawmelonjuice/Henri_The_Datapack)

<div class="derivi-twivi">
'A minecraft datapack revolving around a shady guy named Henri', pretty cringe maybe idk
</div>

### Project Embloidium

<div class="derivi-twivi">
A set of chatbots that could add new reactions on themselves (wouldn't call it AI), that I worked on from my 13th till my 17th, on a combination of
<ul>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>Batch (yes, the windows cmd file thing)</li>
<li>Electron/NodeJS</li>
</ul>
With somehow a pretty good result. Mostly.
</div>

Keeping this code private for now.
