Bella Bee is a first try, after I saw a nature documentary zoom in on bees and I was like "Omg gotta make one". Yeah. Pretty darn proud.

<span class="notion">Bella Bee is mine, you can share from where I share but you may not dewatermark and use Bella Bee without [asking me](mailto:mar@strawmelonjuice.com) and getting my permission! If you want to repost her _with_ the watermark, sure! Just tag me so I too can see what peoplies think!</span>
