Ads. First [google ads, whom I had a lil quarrel with](/blog?p=posts/farewell-gads) (yes, I did dearchive that article specifically so I could link it) about a year back, now adfoc.us — who are great, though their approach feels a bit invasive (they replace links on my site with adwalled links) — I've decided to completely rid this site of ads. 

> Oh, by the by... Google marked [logger-diary.strawmelonjuice.com](https://logger-diary.strawmelonjuice.com) as passing for ads, *only to revoke that pass in three days after I actually turned on the ads.* 

From now on, strawmelonjuice.com and my other site adresses no longer allow ads. And I'm not planning on turning that back. It's done.

<u>*Though,*</u> this does mean I'll be at the hands of your donations completely. So, you've heard this before, but [if you like my content, please consider supporting me](/?p=support).
