Loads of updates coming to Logger-Diary.Online users in the past two months, most of them small enough to go unnoticed. However, I’ll make a small and comprehensible list so they won’t actually go unnoticed!
### <a name="_heading=h.nqbpel2gmexl"></a>#1 – A new theme picker
Our new theme picker has a separate page, and instead of picking based on how pretty the theme image looks, you can preview an example home page before definitely landing on your new diary theme!

This also meant new combo themes! The auto-switching theme between the plain themes and the auto-switching theme between Pastelia and Summernight are now available.

### <a name="_heading=h.ul5elijddu5u"></a>#2 – Strawmelonjuice.com theme
More theme-related news? YES! On many requests, the theme of my home site <strawmelonjuice.com> has been ported to Logger-Diary Online! Check it out when you have the time.

### <a name="_heading=h.2ddnktb3p2iy"></a>#3 – Updates to entry-editor
I think these are the most important ones, so why would I put them all the way down here? No clue, but glad to have you still around!
#### <a name="_heading=h.7jxfico505lj"></a>1: New emoji picker
Ever tried to fit an emotional entry into your diary but couldn’t find the right emoji? Yes. Been there. But emoji-drawer-2 is here to help!
#### <a name="_heading=h.90hlsntv5u1s"></a>2: Pop out my short entries please!
Ever typing something short and realizing you are in fact just trying to fit 15 paragraphs into one line? Yeah… Yeah. Now there’s a popout button! It allows you to quickly expand your short entry-editor to a long one, without having to change the overall settings!
### <a name="_heading=h.skwm4gg2gc9m"></a>#4 – Relative dates for recent entries
You might’ve seen that most of your entries now have ‘20 seconds ago’ instead of ‘July 17 - 1829’ (wait what?!?!), this is because Logger-Diary Online now does the math and calculates relative dates for entries that are under 2 days old. I know, quite impressive huh?

### <a name="_heading=h.3efru4xle6hp"></a>#5 – Dismissable focus mode alert
Ever used focus mode? Yeah, annoying huh? You can now dismiss the focus mode alert and have it kept hidden for about 30 days. It was only ~~5 hours of programming~~ *the addition of ONE button!*

### <a name="_heading=h.tjtcrucbim8s"></a>#6 – B.T.S: Loads of code optimisations and backend updates!
Not only have I physically moved our servers for better connections, I have also updated the code to run more of the critical parts ***on your side***! This might sound weird, but your laptop is far more invested in speedy browsing than our busy servers are; it’s quite happy to help pick up all the slack! Our busy servers meanwhile have new code and new directions.

In short: Your trusted diary app now works even speedier and more secure!
