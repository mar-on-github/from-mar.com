# We moved to a new adress: **https://logger-diary.online**
<button>Mar</button>
<hr />
I moved to a new adress! Logger-Diary has just moved from the old adress under the `from-mar.com` domain name, `logger-diary.from-mar.com`, to a brand new OWN adress: <logger-diary.online>, redirects should work alright and data is untouched. Hosting is still handled by me (mar) as it used to.

This makes typing that link into your browser a whole lot easier!

## Issues?

Mail me at `just [dot] mar [dot] ok2813 [at] gmail [dot] com` or @ me on Twitter: [@Strawmelonjuice](https://twitter.com/Strawmelonjuice)!
