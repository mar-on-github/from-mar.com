<hr />
I moved to a new adress! Logger-Diary has just moved from the old adress under the `from-mar.com` domain name, `logger-diary.from-mar.com`, to a brand new OWN adress: <logger-diary.from-mar.com>, redirects should work alright and data is untouched. Hosting is still handled by me (mar) as it used to.

This makes typing that link into your browser a whole lot easier!
