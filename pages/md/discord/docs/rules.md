# 1\. Behavior in server

- Be nice to each other, we are a group! Cyberbullying is not allowed.

- Discrimination, racism or disabling minorities is NOT allowed and will result in ban or removal.

- Generally ruining the mood is not the way to go, if one of the mods sees you doing this they may kick or temp you. So be careful, as this is a term that can be interpreted in multiple ways, in which case the mod in question decides according to rule \#3.1.

- Use channels as they’re supposed to be used, this goes especially for NSFW content in non-NSFW channels. Wrong usage of channels may result in deletion and possibly a muting, where posting NSFW in non NSFW-channels may even result in a permanent ban.  
  It’s always okay to ask!
  - Using bots should be done in the Spam channel. This even goes for our dearest Pico!  
    This also means that triggering canned responses by sending iffy content has a rate limit and can and can be punishable.

# 2\. Speaking other languages

- The server’s main language is English.

- Speaking other languages in the server is only allowed if not used to exclude others.

- Speaking other languages in the server is only allowed if there is a moderator available in the current channel who also speaks and understands the aforementioned languages.

# 3\. Interacting with mods

- Contradiction to mods in their actions is not tolerated. Mods can be recognized by their Staff role and mod level.

- In case of abuse of power by staff, DM it to me, or to another other staff member – Mar

- Please report any violations of rules to staff via ping or DM.

- After a ban you are not supposed to find a way around it and still get on the server.

- After a kick it is up to the mod to invite you back, if they don’t think it is necessary, consider it a tempban and don’t come back for a week.

- Automod:

  - Automod might be fallible, and if it made a mistake, send a staff member a DM.

  - Automod evasion is a bannable offense, even if the escaped word isn’t.

# 5\. Inviting others

- Our invite link is <https://discord.gg/WXMRxGmyTV>

- Inviting others to try and organise a raid or to help them break rule \#2.4 will be punished with permaban when caught.
