# About me
Hello, I'm Mar! I'm a 19-year-old student from The Netherlands, waitress, music enjoyer, addict to creativity, writer and more.

Wait, you'll understand after you know what my favourite quote is:

> If there’s a book that you want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, then you must write it.
> 
> ― Toni Morrison

So I do. Question is: Will I ever finish writing and publish something?

> Optimist, emotional human, writer, actual witch sometimes, (cool) person, weirdo, me.
> 
> ― Me
