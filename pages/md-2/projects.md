I am a creativity addict so I jiggle around with code from time to time. These are some projects of mine:

## Logger-Diary
<div class="derivi-twivi">
Simple digital diary software
</div>

- <img src="/assets/img/2015logo.png" height="25px" alt="mylog231 logo"> My Log 231 for FreeDOS – discontinued & way too old but I find it funny to mention

## Project FNew
<div class="derivi-twivi">
A social media site that doesn't have a name yet... or a figured out concept
</div>
Not yet open source nor publicized
## [WWW-bot](https://github.com/strawmelonjuice/wwwbot-discord)
<div class="derivi-twivi">
    A discord bot to moderate and automate my cute lil discord server <code>that barely has any members :c</code>
</div>


## [Henri The Datapack](https://github.com/strawmelonjuice/Henri_The_Datapack)

<div class="derivi-twivi">
'A minecraft datapack revolving around a shady guy named Henri', pretty cringe maybe idk
</div>

## Project Embloidium

<div class="derivi-twivi">
A set of chatbots that could add new reactions on themselves (wouldn't call it AI), that I worked on from my 13th till my 17th, on a combination of
<ul>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>Batch (yes, the windows cmd file thing)</li>
<li>Electron/NodeJS</li>
</ul>
With somehow a pretty good result. Mostly.
</div>

Keeping this code private for now.


## This site

<div class="derivi-twivi">
Yeah, this site is a little project of its own (at the time of writing, the one with the most commits lol).
However, it's not open source. Instead, I'm planning to make a separate project that works <i>kinda</i> like this site, as a CMS for small blogs.
